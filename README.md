# port of https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc in rust

## kinda ass tbh, using it is not recommended but it works (i made it for personal use)

### why is it shit:
2. only supports setting the activity
3. no error handling added
4. may break anytime
5. client.js is probably the first thing that would break
6. ipc not supported for windows


there is only one good thing about it. it's light weight; only takes about 3.5mbs ram :)

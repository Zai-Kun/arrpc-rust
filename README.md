# port of https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc in rust

kinda ass, using it is not recommended but it works (i made it for personal use)
only supports setting the activity
no error handling added
may break anytime
client.js is probably the first thing that would break
ipc not supported for windows

there is only one good thing about it. it's light weight; only takes about 3.5mbs ram :)
